# CONTRIBUTING
First of all, thanks for the help! If you need help, take a look at the Discussions.

## Publishing a Pull request
If you publish a new Pull request, please make sure that the code is working and passes all tests. Please publish no malware or moral incorrect content.

If there is a entry in the [wiki](https://github.com/dgc08/stl/wiki) or [README.md](https://github.com/dgc08/stl/blob/master/README.md) that affected from your modification, please update them too.

If you want to publish new functionalitys, create a Pull request to the `developement` branch. Otherwise, if you don't change much, e.g fixing Bugs, you can create the Pull request for the `master` branch directly.
